# Random small groups script

Script for partitioning people in groups such that the generated groups have
small overlap with any past groups. See the header comment of
`random-small-groups` and the result of running `python3 random-small-groups
--help` for details.

The original use case for this was that I wanted to regularly partition a set of
people into small groups to assign them to eat lunch together. I wanted each
resulting group to not resemble any past lunch group and to not contain too many
people who already regularly work together.
